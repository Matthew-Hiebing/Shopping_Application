# Shopping_Application

This project was put together to learn more about user creation, passwords, password validation, using express, and working with user created data.  The shopping applicatino mimicks a typical shopping website like Amazon or eBay but does not allow you to buy anything.  Products can be added, deleted, or updated in the user admin panel once you're logged in.  Pictures are stored as strings for now but should be stored on an online program.

## Installation
```bash
npm install express-validator # Provides validators for username, passwords, etc.
npm install cookie-session # Provides cookies for server requests.
npm install express # Provides routing capabilities on website.
npm install multer # Allows you to send multi-part form data (like pictures).
npm install nodemon # Automatically restarts server after changes are made, good for catching erros and seeing server status.
```
